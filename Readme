Known issues/unfixed bugs:

* Linux and Mac: D&T doesn't work. This has to do with the fact RLVM was not
 made for it. It hasn't been fixed yet, and it won't be fixed for a while. It
 requires the reprogramming of that entire section. If you wish to do that,
 feel free to try and redo it.

* Font selection:  The default font used is MS Gothic with bolding and shadows
enabled. The font options are not currently functioning properly.  Attempts to
change the font will result in using the lowest quality, no-shadow, no bolding
version of the selected font.  It is not possible to revert back to the
default font as set up without reinstalling the patch. 

* Line Overruns:  Luckily the game doesn't crash when a large chunk of text runs
over the 3-lines allocated to it.  It does, however, cause some odd corruption
of the name tag box.  This is likely an issue inside of rlbable, as this
behavior doesn't appear on other VNs that share the same resources. 

* Game refuses to load when starting up:  Usually just restarting the game is
enough to fix most of these.  

* Game refuses to load D&T: Usually just restarting the game is enough to fix
this

* Known Crash Issues: From the start-up screen, attempting to load a save on the
first line of July 14th will crash the game. l 

* D&T line-overruns:  The auto-line breaking used throughout the game doesn't
work properly for D&T. We are working on either fixing it or adding in manual
line breaks.

* (this line depends on if skills make it in or not)  D&T skill cut-ins:  The
skill cut-ins have caused us a lot of issues becuase much of how it's positioned
and displayed is embedded into xml code attached to the images as well as game
code used to execute some semi-fancy display effects.  We've come up with a
solution that looks much better in English, and are in the process of deploying
it.  

* There are some known errors in the D&T Translation.  We are reviewing
everything once more.

* D&T item name inconsistency:  There are a handful of item and skill images 
that are inconsistent with the text.  Some of this is intentional, due to space
limits, but we are still working on fixing all the inconsistencies.  

* D&T item puns:  The bane of translation effort, there are a frightful number
of puns with the item names and descriptions.  Figuring them all out of half the
battle, trying to properly convey them the other half. l
 
* Some system message titles still in JP:  We've tried to catch everything, but
there are some occasional system messages (like if you try to close the program
through alt+f4) that are still in JP.
