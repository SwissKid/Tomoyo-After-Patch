TO OTHER DEVELOPERS/DOKI:
    To update the patch with the newest files just replace SEEN.TXT and the
files in G00/MOV with what's needed.

    If you modify any files outside of G00/MOV the install script will need to
be modified, the for loop that is currently assigned to 'SEEN* rlBabel.dll
1.3.5.4.map GAMEEXE.INI G00 MOV' will need to have the new filder
names added.
