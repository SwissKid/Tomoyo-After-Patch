Linux Instructions:
If GTK is installed (on most systems this is true), first attempt to run the
"gtkinstall." If that doesn't work, try the cmdinstall. If that doesn't work
either, follow the manual installation instructions.

If GTK is not installed, it should be, but you can try the cmdinstall.

OSX Instructions:
The osxinstall script is not ready quite yet, though you're welcome to try it.
Most likely you will have to run the osxcmdinstall script, though there may
still be bugs in that. The manual install is your best bet.



Manual Installation Instructions:
This installer works by simply copying the files into the correct directories,
and creating an executable to automatically run the RLVM command. This can be
done manually by following these steps:
    1: From the mounted CD of Tomoyo After copy:
	bgm dat gan koe mov sys wav 
	to a new directoy that you want to contain Tomoyo After
    2: Rename those files to all caps, so they will be:
	BGM DAT GAN KOE MOV SYS WAV 
	(you will also have to do this to the subdirectrories, so that could end
	up being a lot more work than planned. Read notes for an alternative
	way)
    3: From this directoy move SEEN.TXT, SEEN0728.TXT, GAMEEXE.INI, and the G00
    and MOV folders into the 'installed' Tomyo After directory
    4: Install the latest version of RLVM from the git to fix the issues with
    weird backgrounds occasionally. If you don't care much about that (not game
    breaking) you may use the binary on the site.
    5: Execute RLVM and choose the directory. You're now playing the patched
    version of Tomoyo After!

NOTES: Rather than replace every file in the G00 directory, you may just look at
the new g00 files and delete the similarly named originals. Also, the files that
aren't going to be replaced (DAT, BGM, GAN, SYS, WAV) don't actually have to be
changed to all caps. Neither do the folder directories. The only reason this is
done is because the new files are all caps, and to facilitate drag-and-drop.
