Need to move the font into directory. Probably ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts/
Need to isntall from the ISO. The files moved are:
	BGM directory
	DAT directory
	DT00.dll
	Gameexe.ini
	g00
	koe
	gan
	manual
	mov
	RealLive.exe
	seen.txt
	sys
	tomoyo.ico
	wav

Don't know how to show a progress bar with cp, rsync won't show as a whole,
only individually.

LINUX SPECIAL NOTES (TO GO WITH RELEASE):

The "choose font" doesn't work in game, you specify in the command line before
you run the game.
